 Class hierarchy:

- astro::SkyFunction - abstract base class defining a real function on the sphere (a function of a astro::SkyDir)
- skymaps::SkyImage - implement SkyFunction with FITS image; also create from a SkyFunction
- skymaps::SkySpectrum - abstract, allow specification of energy spectrum at any point
- skymaps::DiffuseFunction - interpolate a FITS cube. Used for the background for point source fits.
- skymaps::PhotonMap - pixelized photon data 
- skymaps::Convolution - convolution of a SkySpectrum object with another SkySpectrum, perhaps a PSF.
- skymaps::CompositeSkySpectrum - linear combination of SkySpectrum objects. Used to combine the galactic diffuse with nearby (< 1deg) strong sources
- skymaps::Exposure - Integrate an expouse cube over the acceptance to define the exposure at any point.

Also include copies of the two good time interval (GTI) classes from the rest of the Science Tools,
to avoid considerable unrelated dependencies

- skymaps::GTI -- Manage good time intervals
